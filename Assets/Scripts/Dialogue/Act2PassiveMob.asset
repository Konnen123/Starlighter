  npcDialogue:
  - Greetings young one, how may I be of assistance to you?
  - Ah, it appears that the elderly gentleman has deceived you. He cunningly lured
    you into a labyrinthine realm through teleportation, allowing him to evade capture.
    Furthermore, the valuable item in question was never pilfered as he had it in
    his possession all along.
  - To confront him successfully, you must engage him within the confines of his
    own dreamscape, where his immortality holds sway. Utilize this teleportation
    device to gain entry into his subconscious realm.
  - Regrettably, I am not skilled in the art of combat. Nonetheless, I am aware that
    his vulnerabilities lie within his eyes.
  playerDialogue:
  - Give the artifact that was taken from planet Abronoe!
  - 'How can I beat him? '
  - Can you help me?
