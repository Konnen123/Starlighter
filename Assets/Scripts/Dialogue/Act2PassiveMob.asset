  npcDialogue:
  - Hello child, how can I help you?
  - Ha, I guess the old man fooled you. He tricked you into teleporting in a maze
    world so he can escape from you. The artifact was never stolen, he has the artifact.
  - You have to challenge him in his own dreams, in this universe he is immortal.
    Use this teleporter to enter his mind.
  - Sorry, I don't know how to fight. However, I know his weak spots are his eyes
  playerDialogue:
  - Give me the artifact that you stole from planet Abronoe!
  - 'How can I beat him? '
  - Can you help me?
